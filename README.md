# Oread
A commandline and GUI tool for the creation of Artemis/Artemis Comparison Tool files.

# Installation

So far this has only been tested on MacOS. For this, a "framework" version of python is needed.
This can be installed via `conda` which is strongly recommended, and then the script run with the
`pythonw` binary:


    $ pythonw Artemisia.py

This will open the window. If you set the `Artemisia.py` script to be executable (it should already be)
and to open with `Terminal` by default (select the file, `Command+I`, then alter the defaults), you can launch
with a double click.
